## Description
Methods for analyzing algorithms are discussed including an introduction to asymptotic notation. Several approaches to designing algorithms are covered using theory, examples and problems. Those approaches include divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, the greedy approach backtracking and branch-and-bound. Different approaches are applied to the same problem to illuminate the relative advantages.
