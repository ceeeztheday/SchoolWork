This exercise begins with a simple class named Rectangle.

The first step in the exercise is to do the following:
   1) add a static variable numberOfRectangles to the Rectangle class;
   2) complete the getNumberOfRectangles method;
   3) complet the overridden equals() method.
   
The second step is to add the code necessary to allow Rectangle to become 
a subclass of the abstract class Shape. Once this is done, class Rectangle
will use only the displayObjectType( ) method from the parent class Shape.
Note: class Rectangle must still account for the other abstract components 
of class Shape. (Note: to simplify the process, copy and past the abstract
methods from Shape into Rectangle. Then proceed to mofidfy the methods.

The third step is to bring in the interface IShape. For this exercise, 
only the getArea( ) method will be used. Remember that all methods of 
IShape must be handled.
